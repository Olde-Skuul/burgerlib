	management across a development team.

	This class is not intended for shipping code. It's inclusion
	in a shipping game application is discouraged.

	p4 is located by first looking at the PERFORCE environment variable, scanning
	the default install folders and finally a search of the PATH environment
	variable. If it's not found, this call will fail.
