# Directplay

Directplay is stored here for historical reasons. It should never be used for future applications. Burgerlib has APIs that will detect, load and call Directplay functions in order to be compatible with older codebases.

## Don't use Directplay for any new applications

You've been warned.

## Source of the SDK

The SDK is obtained directly from the DirectX SDK (August 2007) with only minor modifications to remove compiler warnings
